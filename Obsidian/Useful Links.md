This can be an alternative in those countries where cryptography is illegal. Also, the point of using steganography is to communicate with “innocent” messages that does not attract attention in contrast with plain encrypted messages that certainly will atract attention.

Robustness, security and hiding capacity are the three major performance criteria that revolve around the existing steganography methods. 
The most important properties include robustness to noise, to compression and to signal manipulation, as well as the security and the hiding-capacity of hidden data. The robustness requirement is tightly coupled with the application, and is also the most challenging requirement to fulfill in a steganographic system when traded with data hiding-capacity. Generally, the robustness and the capacity hardly coexist in the same steganographic system due to tradeoffs imbalance between these two criteria where increased robustness levels result in decreasing data hiding capacity.
In addition, most steganalysis efforts are more directed towards digital images leaving audio steganalysis relatively unexplored.
